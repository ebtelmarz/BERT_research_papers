75,4,"a theory of problemsolving behavior. in this paper we develop a formal, testable theory of problem-solving behavior with special relevance to individuals and small groups. the theory is consistent with principles drawn from operant behavior and social exchange theories but also incorporates elements of cognitive psychology. problem solving is defined as a nonroutine activity oriented toward changing an undesirable state of affairs. the focus on change differentiates problem solving from coping, which is oriented toward relieving feelings of stress. a decision-making model is presented, which takes the problem-solving process through its latter stages. the theory is based on two axioms and three theorems pertaining to the process of decision making. these axioms and theorems serve as the foundation for deriving 14 theorems that establish the antecedent conditions affecting decisions relevnat to each of four stages in the problem-solving process. this theory is distinguished from other problem-solving theories in its effort to account for conditions leading to awareness of problems and in its emphasis on generic problem-solving processes rather than on the effectiveness of problem-solving outcomes.","comparative assessment of largescale data sets of proteinprotein interactions. comprehensive protein protein interaction maps promise to reveal many aspects of the complex regulatory network underlying cellular function. recently, large-scale approaches have predicted many new protein interactions in yeast. to measure their accuracy and potential as well as to identify biases, strengths and weaknesses, we compare the methods with each other and with a reference set of previously reported protein interactions.",3

53,52,"analysis of weighted networks. the connections in many networks are not merely binary entities, either present or not, but have associated weights that record their strengths relative to one another. recent studies of networks have, by and large, steered clear of such weighted networks, which are often perceived as being harder to analyze than their unweighted counterparts. here we point out that weighted networks can in many cases be analyzed using a simple mapping from a weighted network to an unweighted multigraph, allowing us to apply standard techniques for unweighted graphs to weighted ones as well. we give a number of examples of the method, including an algorithm for detecting community structure in weighted networks and a simple proof of the maximum-flowâminimum-cut theorem.","fluctuations in network dynamics. most complex networks serve as conduits for various dynamical processes, ranging from mass transfer by chemical reactions in the cell to packet transfer on the internet. we collected data on the time dependent activity of five natural and technological networks, finding that for each the coupling of the flux fluctuations with the total flux on individual nodes obeys a unique scaling law. we show that the observed scaling can explain the competition between the system's internal collective dynamics and changes in the external environment, allowing us to predict the relevant scaling exponents.",3

7,62,"artificial gene networks for objective comparison of analysis algorithms. motivation: large-scale gene expression profiling generates data sets that are rich in observed features but poor in numbers of observations. the analysis of such data sets is a challenge that has been object of vigorous research. the algorithms in use for this purpose have been poorly documented and rarely compared objectively, posing a problem of uncertainty about the outcomes of the analyses. one way to objectively test such analysis algorithms is to apply them on computational gene network models for which the mechanisms are completely know.  results: we present a system that generates random artificial   gene networks according to well-defined topological and kinetic   properties. these are used to run in silico experiments simulating   real laboratory microarray experiments. noise with controlled   properties is added to the simulation results several times   emulating measurement replicates, before expression ratios are calculated.  availability: the data sets and kinetic models described here are available from http://www.vbi.vt.edu/~mendes/agn/as  biochemical dynamic models in sbml and gepasi formats.  contact: mendes@vt.edu 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg1069","network dynamics and cell physiology. complex assemblies of interacting proteins carry out most of the interesting jobs in a cell, such as metabolism, dna synthesis, movement and information processing. these physiological properties play out as a subtle molecular dance, choreographed by underlying regulatory networks. to understand this dance, a new breed of theoretical molecular biologists reproduces these networks in computers and in the mathematical language of dynamical systems.",3
