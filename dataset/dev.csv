330,25,70,"spectra of realworld graphs beyond the semicircle law. many natural and social systems develop complex networks, that are usually modelled as random graphs. the eigenvalue spectrum of these graphs provides information about their structural properties. while the semi-circle law is known to describe the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs, much less is known about the eigenvalues of real-world graphs, describing such complex systems as the internet, metabolic pathways, networks of power stations, scientific collaborations or movie actors, which are inherently correlated and usually very sparse. an important limitation in addressing the spectra of these systems is that the numerical determination of the spectra for systems with more than a few thousand nodes is prohibitively time and memory consuming. making use of recent advances in algorithms for spectral characterization, here we develop new methods to determine the eigenvalues of networks comparable in size to real systems, obtaining several surprising results on the spectra of adjacency matrices corresponding to models of real-world graphs. we find that when the number of links grows as the number of nodes, the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs does not converge to the semi-circle law. furthermore, the spectral densities of real-world graphs have specific features depending on the details of the corresponding models. in particular, scale-free graphs develop a triangle-like spectral density with a power law tail, while small-world graphs have a complex spectral density function consisting of several sharp peaks. these and further results indicate that the spectra of correlated graphs represent a practical tool for graph classification and can provide useful insight into the relevant structural properties of real networks.","information foraging. information foraging theory is an approach to understanding how strategies and technologies for information seeking, gathering, and consumption are adapted to the flux of information in the environment. the theory assumes that people, when possible, will modify their strategies or the structure of the environment to maximize their rate of gaining valuable information. the theory is developed by (a) adaptation (rational) analysis of information foraging problems and (b) a detailed process model (adaptive control of thought in information foraging [act-if]). the adaptation analysis develops (a) information patch models, which deal with time allocation and information filtering and enrichment activities in environments in which information is encountered in clusters; (b) information scent models, which address the identification of information value from proximal cues; and (c) information diet models, which address decisions about the selection and pursuit of information items. act-if is instantiated as a production system model of people interacting with complex information technology. humans actively seek, gather, share, and consume information to a degree unapproached by other organisms. ours might properly be characterized as a species of informavores (dennett, 1991). our adaptive success depends to a large extent on a vast and complex",3

(i) the so called small-world effect. in particular, the average distance between two words, d (i.e. the average minimum number of links to be crossed from an arbitrary word to another), is shown to be d approximately equal to 2-3, even though the human brain can store many thousands. (ii) a scale-free distribution of degrees. the known pronounced effects of disconnecting the most connected vertices in such networks can be identified in some language disorders. these observations indicate some unexpected features of language organization that might reflect the evolutionary and social history of lexicons and the origins of their flexibility and combinatorial nature.","highthroughput classification of yeast mutants for functional genomics using metabolic footprinting. many technologies have been developed to help explain the function of genes discovered by systematic genome sequencing. at present, transcriptome and proteome studies dominate large-scale functional analysis strategies. yet the metabolome, because it is 'downstream', should show greater effects of genetic or physiological changes and thus should be much closer to the phenotype of the organism. we earlier presented a functional analysis strategy that used metabolic fingerprinting to reveal the phenotype of silent mutations of yeast genes. however, this is difficult to scale up for high-throughput screening. here we present an alternative that has the required throughput (2 min per sample). this 'metabolic footprinting' approach recognizes the significance of 'overflow metabolism' in appropriate media. measuring intracellular metabolites is time-consuming and subject to technical difficulties caused by the rapid turnover of intracellular metabolites and the need to quench metabolism and separate metabolites from the extracellular space. we therefore focused instead on direct, noninvasive, mass spectrometric monitoring of extracellular metabolites in spent culture medium. metabolic footprinting can distinguish between different physiological states of wild-type yeast and between yeast single-gene deletion mutants even from related areas of metabolism. by using appropriate clustering and machine learning techniques, the latter based on genetic programming, we show that metabolic footprinting is an effective method to classify 'unknown' mutants by genetic defect.",3

7920,87,57,"bridging epistemologies the generative dance between organizational knowledge and organizational knowing. much current work on organizational knowledge, intellectual capital, knowledge-creating organizations, knowledge work, and the like rests on a single, traditional understanding of the nature of knowledge. we call this understanding the ""epistemology of possession,"" since it treats knowledge as something people possess. yet, this epistemology cannot account for the knowing found in individual and group practice. knowing as action calls for an ""epistemology of practice."" moreover, the epistemology of possession tends to privilege explicit over tacit knowledge, and knowledge possessed by individuals over that possessed by groups. current work on organizations is limited by this privileging and by the scant attention given to knowing in its own right. organizations are better understood if explicit, tacit, individual and group knowledge are treated as four distinct and coequal forms of knowledge (each doing work the others cannot), and if knowledge and knowing are seen as mutually enabling (not competing). we hold that knowledge is a tool of knowing, that knowing is an aspect of our interaction with the social and physical world, and that the interplay of knowledge and knowing can generate new knowledge and new ways of knowing. we believe this generative dance between knowledge and knowing is a powerful source of organizational innovation. harnessing this innovation calls for organizational and technological infrastructures that support the interplay of knowledge and knowing. ultimately, these concepts make possible a more robust framing of such epistemologically-centered concerns as core competencies, the management of intellectual capital, etc. we explore these views through three brief case studies drawn from recent research. 10.1287/orsc.10.4.381","here is the evidence now what is the hypothesis the complementary roles of inductive and hypothesisdriven science in the postgenomic era. abstract it is considered in some quarters that hypothesis-driven methods are the only valuable, reliable or significant means of scientific advance. data-driven or âinductiveâ advances in scientific knowledge are then seen as marginal, irrelevant, insecure or wrong-headed, while the development of technologyâwhich is not of itself âhypothesis-ledâ (beyond the recognition that such tools might be of value)âmust be seen as equally irrelevant to the hypothetico-deductive scientific agenda. we argue here that data- and technology-driven programmes are not alternatives to hypothesis-led studies in scientific knowledge discovery but are complementary and iterative partners with them. many fields are data-rich but hypothesis-poor. here, computational methods of data analysis, which may be automated, provide the means of generating novel hypotheses, especially in the post-genomic era. bioessays 26:99â105, 2004. â© 2003 wiley periodicals, inc.",3

8572,76,60,"sticky information and the locus of problem solving implications for innovation. to solve a problem, needed information and problem-solving capabilities must be brought together. often the information used in technical problem solving is costly to acquire, transfer, and use in a new location-is, in our terms, sticky. in this paper we explore the impact of information stickiness on the locus of innovation-related problem solving. we find, first, that when sticky information needed by problem solvers is held at one site only, problem solving will be carried out at that locus, other things being equal. second, when more than one locus of sticky information is called upon by problem solvers, the locus of problem solving may iterate among these sites as problem solving proceeds. when the costs of such iteration are high, then, third, problems that draw upon multiple sites of sticky information will sometimes be task partitioned into subproblems that each draw on only one such locus, and/or, fourth, investments will be made to reduce the stickiness of information at some locations. information stickiness appears to affect a number of issues of importance to researchers and practitioners. among these are patterns in the diffusion of information, the specialization of firms, the locus of innovation, and the nature of problems selected by problem solvers.","schemes of flux control in a model of saccharomyces cerevisiae glycolysis. we used parameter scanning to emulate changes to the limiting rate for steps in a fitted model of glucose-derepressed yeast glycolysis. three flux-control regimes were observed, two of which were under the dominant control of hexose transport, in accordance with various experimental studies and other model predictions. a third control regime in which phosphofructokinase exerted dominant glycolytic flux control was also found, but it appeared to be physiologically unreachable by this model, and all realistically obtainable flux control regimes featured hexose transport as a step involving high flux control.",3

8914,91,25,"whats in a name. among the several findings deriving from the application of complex network formalism to the investigation of natural phenomena, the fact that linguistic constructions follow power laws presents special interest for its potential implications for psychology and brain science. by corresponding to one of the most essentially human manifestations, such language-related properties suggest that similar dynamics may also be inherent to the brain areas related to language and associative memory, and perhaps even consciousness. the present work reports a preliminary experimental investigation aimed at characterizing and modeling the flow of sequentially induced associations between words from the english language in terms of complex networks. the data is produced through a psychophysical experiment where a word is presented to the subject, who is requested to associate another word. complex network and graph theory formalism and measurements are applied in order to characterize the experimental data. several interesting results are identified, including the characterization of attraction basins, association asymmetries, context biasing, as well as a possible power-law underlying word associations, which could be explained by the appearance of strange loops along the hierarchical structure underlying word categories.","spectra of realworld graphs beyond the semicircle law. many natural and social systems develop complex networks, that are usually modelled as random graphs. the eigenvalue spectrum of these graphs provides information about their structural properties. while the semi-circle law is known to describe the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs, much less is known about the eigenvalues of real-world graphs, describing such complex systems as the internet, metabolic pathways, networks of power stations, scientific collaborations or movie actors, which are inherently correlated and usually very sparse. an important limitation in addressing the spectra of these systems is that the numerical determination of the spectra for systems with more than a few thousand nodes is prohibitively time and memory consuming. making use of recent advances in algorithms for spectral characterization, here we develop new methods to determine the eigenvalues of networks comparable in size to real systems, obtaining several surprising results on the spectra of adjacency matrices corresponding to models of real-world graphs. we find that when the number of links grows as the number of nodes, the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs does not converge to the semi-circle law. furthermore, the spectral densities of real-world graphs have specific features depending on the details of the corresponding models. in particular, scale-free graphs develop a triangle-like spectral density with a power law tail, while small-world graphs have a complex spectral density function consisting of several sharp peaks. these and further results indicate that the spectra of correlated graphs represent a practical tool for graph classification and can provide useful insight into the relevant structural properties of real networks.",3

9048,58,73,"highthroughput classification of yeast mutants for functional genomics using metabolic footprinting. many technologies have been developed to help explain the function of genes discovered by systematic genome sequencing. at present, transcriptome and proteome studies dominate large-scale functional analysis strategies. yet the metabolome, because it is 'downstream', should show greater effects of genetic or physiological changes and thus should be much closer to the phenotype of the organism. we earlier presented a functional analysis strategy that used metabolic fingerprinting to reveal the phenotype of silent mutations of yeast genes. however, this is difficult to scale up for high-throughput screening. here we present an alternative that has the required throughput (2 min per sample). this 'metabolic footprinting' approach recognizes the significance of 'overflow metabolism' in appropriate media. measuring intracellular metabolites is time-consuming and subject to technical difficulties caused by the rapid turnover of intracellular metabolites and the need to quench metabolism and separate metabolites from the extracellular space. we therefore focused instead on direct, noninvasive, mass spectrometric monitoring of extracellular metabolites in spent culture medium. metabolic footprinting can distinguish between different physiological states of wild-type yeast and between yeast single-gene deletion mutants even from related areas of metabolism. by using appropriate clustering and machine learning techniques, the latter based on genetic programming, we show that metabolic footprinting is an effective method to classify 'unknown' mutants by genetic defect.","design and implementation of microarray gene expression markup language mageml. background: meaningful exchange of microarray data is currently difficult because it is rare that published data provide sufficient information depth or are even in the same format from one publication to another. only when data can be easily exchanged will the entire biological community be able to derive the full benefit from such microarray studies. results: to this end we have developed three key ingredients towards standardizing the storage and exchange of microarray data. first, we have created a minimal information for the annotation of a microarray experiment (miame)-compliant conceptualization of microarray experiments modeled using the unified modeling language (uml) named mage-om (microarray gene expression object model). second, we have translated mage-om into an xml-based data format, mage-ml, to facilitate the exchange of data. third, some of us are now using mage (or its progenitors) in data production settings. finally, we have developed a freely available software tool kit (mage-stk) that eases the integration of mage-ml into end users' systems. conclusions: mage will help microarray data producers and users to exchange information by providing a common platform for data exchange, and mage-stk will make the adoption of mage easier.",3
