2192,53,62,"analysis of weighted networks. the connections in many networks are not merely binary entities, either present or not, but have associated weights that record their strengths relative to one another. recent studies of networks have, by and large, steered clear of such weighted networks, which are often perceived as being harder to analyze than their unweighted counterparts. here we point out that weighted networks can in many cases be analyzed using a simple mapping from a weighted network to an unweighted multigraph, allowing us to apply standard techniques for unweighted graphs to weighted ones as well. we give a number of examples of the method, including an algorithm for detecting community structure in weighted networks and a simple proof of the maximum-flowâminimum-cut theorem.","network dynamics and cell physiology. complex assemblies of interacting proteins carry out most of the interesting jobs in a cell, such as metabolism, dna synthesis, movement and information processing. these physiological properties play out as a subtle molecular dance, choreographed by underlying regulatory networks. to understand this dance, a new breed of theoretical molecular biologists reproduces these networks in computers and in the mathematical language of dynamical systems.",3

2199,52,13,"fluctuations in network dynamics. most complex networks serve as conduits for various dynamical processes, ranging from mass transfer by chemical reactions in the cell to packet transfer on the internet. we collected data on the time dependent activity of five natural and technological networks, finding that for each the coupling of the flux fluctuations with the total flux on individual nodes obeys a unique scaling law. we show that the observed scaling can explain the competition between the system's internal collective dynamics and changes in the external environment, allowing us to predict the relevant scaling exponents.","diffusion on complex networks a way to probe their large scale topological structures. a diffusion process on complex networks is introduced in order to uncover their large scale topological structures. this is achieved by focusing on the slowest decaying diffusive modes of the network. the proposed procedure is applied to real-world networks like a friendship network of known modular structure, and an internet routing network. for the friendship network, its known structure is well reproduced. in case of the internet, where the structure is far less well-known, one indeed finds a modular structure, and modules can roughly be associated with individual countries. quantitatively the modular structure of the internet manifests itself in an approximately 10 times larger participation ratio of its slowest decaying modes as compared to the null model -- a random scale-free network. the extreme edges of the internet are found to correspond to russian and us military sites.",3
