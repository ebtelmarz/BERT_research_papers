2200,37,42,"initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome. the sequence of the mouse genome is a key informational tool for understanding the contents of the human genome and a key experimental tool for biomedical research. here, we report the results of an international collaboration to produce a high-quality draft sequence of the mouse genome. we also present an initial comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes, describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the two sequences. we discuss topics including the analysis of the evolutionary forces shaping the size, structure and sequence of the genomes; the conservation of large-scale synteny across most of the genomes; the much lower extent of sequence orthology covering less than half of the genomes; the proportions of the genomes under selection; the number of protein-coding genes; the expansion of gene families related to reproduction and immunity; the evolution of proteins; and the identification of intraspecies polymorphism.","xml bioinformatics and data integration. motivation: the extensible markup language (xml) is an emerging standard for structuring documents, notably for the world wide web. in this paper, the authors present xml and examine its use as a data language for bioinformatics. in particular, xml is compared to other languages, and some of the potential uses of xml in bioinformatics applications are presented. the authors propose to adopt xml for data interchange between databases and other sources of data. finally the discussion is illustrated by a test case of a pedigree data model in xml. contact: emmanuel.barillot@infobiogen.fr",3
2201,62,19,"network dynamics and cell physiology. complex assemblies of interacting proteins carry out most of the interesting jobs in a cell, such as metabolism, dna synthesis, movement and information processing. these physiological properties play out as a subtle molecular dance, choreographed by underlying regulatory networks. to understand this dance, a new breed of theoretical molecular biologists reproduces these networks in computers and in the mathematical language of dynamical systems.","spectra and eigenvectors of scalefree networks. we study the spectra and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices of scale-free networks when bidirectional interaction is allowed, so that the adjacency matrix is real and symmetric. the spectral density shows an exponential decay around the center, followed by power-law long tails at both spectrum edges. the largest eigenvalue lambda1 depends on system size n as lambda1 approximately n1/4 for large n, and the corresponding eigenfunction is strongly localized at the hub, the vertex with largest degree. the component of the normalized eigenfunction at the hub is of order unity. we also find that the mass gap scales as n(-0.68).",2
2204,38,81,"dynamic conditional random fields. conditional random fields (crfs) for sequence modeling have several  advantages over joint models such as hmms, including the ability to  relax strong independence assumptions made in those models, and the  ability to incorporate arbitrary overlapping features. previous work has  focused on linear-chain crfs, which correspond to finite-state machines,  and have efficient exact inference algorithms. often, however, we wish  to label sequence data in multiple interacting ways---for example,...","coarsegraining and selfdissimilarity of complex networks. can complex engineered and biological networks be coarse-grained into smaller and more understandable versions in which each node represents an entire pattern in the original network? to address this, we define coarse-graining units as connectivity patterns which can serve as the nodes of a coarse-grained network and present algorithms to detect them. we use this approach to systematically reverse-engineer electronic circuits, forming understandable high-level maps from incomprehensible transistor wiring: first, a coarse-grained version in which each node is a gate made of several transistors is established. then the coarse-grained network is itself coarse-grained, resulting in a high-level blueprint in which each node is a circuit module made of many gates. we apply our approach also to a mammalian protein signal-transduction network, to find a simplified coarse-grained network with three main signaling channels that resemble multi-layered perceptrons made of cross-interacting map-kinase cascades. we find that both biological and electronic networks are ""self-dissimilar,"" with different network motifs at each level. the present approach may be used to simplify a variety of directed and nondirected, natural and designed networks.",3
