2185,5,29,"navigation in a small world. the small-world phenomenon â the principle that most of us are linked by short chains of acquaintances â was first investigated as a question in sociology1, 2 and is a feature of a range of networks arising in nature and technology3, 4, 5. experimental study of the phenomenon1 revealed that it has two fundamental components: first, such short chains are ubiquitous, and second, individuals operating with purely local information are very adept at finding these chains. the first issue has been analysed2, 3, 4, and here i investigate the second by modelling how individuals can find short chains in a large social network.","the structure and function of complex networks. inspired by empirical studies of networked systems such as the internet, social networks, and bio- logical networks, researchers have in recent years developed a variety of techniques and models to help us understand or predict the behavior of these systems. here we review developments in this field, including such concepts as the small-world effect, degree distributions, clustering, network correlations, random graph models, models of network growth and preferential attachment, and dynamical processes taking place on networks.",2
2190,97,33,"the economic implications of learning by doing. demonstrates that technical change is attributable to experience. the cumulative production of capital goods is used as the index of experience.  new capital goods are assumed to completely embody technical change. the assumption is made that the model will be operating in an environment of full employment although reference is made throughout to the case of capital shortage.         the implications of this model on wage earners are discussed, and profits and investments are examined. the rate of return is determined by the expected rate of increase in wages, current labor costs per unit output, and the physical lifetime of the investment. learning is an act of investment that benefits future investors. further analysis shows that the socially optimal ratio of gross investment to output is higher than the competitive level.

2191,68,33,"inferring web communities from link topology. dag&amp;x.berkeley.edu kleinberqcs.cornell.edu the world wide web grows through a decentralized, almost anarchic process, and this has resulted in a large hyperlinked corpus without the kind of logical organiza-tion that can be built into more tradit,ionally-created hy-permedia. to extract, meaningful structure under such circumstances, we develop a notion of hyperlinked com-munities on the www t,hrough an analysis of the link topology. by invoking a simple, mathematically clean method for defining and exposing the structure of these communities, we are able to derive a number of themes: the communities can be viewed as containing a core of central, âauthoritative â pages linked tog&amp;her by âhub pages â ; and they exhibit a natural type of hierarchical topic generalization that can be inferred directly from the pat,t,ern of linkage. our investigation shows that al-though the process by which users of the web create pages and links is very difficult to understand at a âlo-cal â level, it results in a much greater degree of orderly high-level structure than has typically been assumed.","mobility in collaboration. this paper addresses an issue that has received little attention within cscw - the requirements to support mobility within collaborative activities. by examining three quite different settings each with differing technological support, we examine the ways in which mobility is critical to collaborative work. we suggest that taking mobility seriously may not only contribute our understanding of current support for collaboration, but raise more general issues concerning the requirements for mobile and other technologies.",3

2195,45,90,"mapping weblog communities. websites of a particular class form increasingly complex networks, and new tools are needed to map and understand them. a way of visualizing this complex network is by mapping it. a map highlights which members of the community have similar interests, and reveals the underlying social network. in this paper, we will map a network of websites using kohonen's self-organizing map (som), a neural-net like method generally used for clustering and visualization of complex data sets. the set of websites considered has been the blogalia weblog hosting site (based at <a href=""http://www.blogalia.com/"">this http url</a>), a thriving community of around 200 members, created in january 2002. in this paper we show how som discovers interesting community features, its relation with other community-discovering algorithms, and the way it highlights the set of communities formed over the network.","how can we think the complex. this chapter does not deal with specific tools and techniques for managing complex systems, but proposes some basic concepts that help us to think and speak about complexity. we review classical thinking and its intrinsic drawbacks when dealing with complexity. we then show how complexity forces us to take build models with indeterminacy and unpredictability. however, we can still deal with the problems created in this way by being adaptive, and profiting from a complex systemâs capability for selforganization, and the distributed intelligence this may produce.",3
2198,46,60,"understanding mobile contexts. mobile urban environments present a challenge for context-aware computers because they differ from fixed indoor contexts such as offices, meeting rooms, and lecture halls in many important ways. internal factors such as tasks and goals are differentâexternal factors such as social resources are dynamic and unpredictable. an empirical, user-centred approach is needed to understand mobile contexts. in this paper, we present insights from an ethnomethodologically inspired study of 25 adult urbanites in helsinki. the results describe typical phenomena in mobility: how situational and planned acts intermesh in navigation, how people construct personal and group spaces, and how temporal tensions develop and dissolve. furthermore, we provide examples of social solutions to navigation problems, examine mobile multitasking, and consider design implications for mobile and context-aware humanâcomputer interaction.","schemes of flux control in a model of saccharomyces cerevisiae glycolysis. we used parameter scanning to emulate changes to the limiting rate for steps in a fitted model of glucose-derepressed yeast glycolysis. three flux-control regimes were observed, two of which were under the dominant control of hexose transport, in accordance with various experimental studies and other model predictions. a third control regime in which phosphofructokinase exerted dominant glycolytic flux control was also found, but it appeared to be physiologically unreachable by this model, and all realistically obtainable flux control regimes featured hexose transport as a step involving high flux control.",3
2202,78,23,"problems with fitting to the powerlaw distribution. abstract. this short communication uses a simple experiment to show that fitting to a power law distribution by using graphical methods based on linear fit on the log-log scale is biased and inaccurate. it shows that using maximum likelihood estimation (mle) is far more robust. finally, it presents a new table for performing the kolmogorov-smirnov test for goodness-of-fit tailored to power-law distributions in which the power-law exponent is estimated using mle. the techniques presented here will advance the application of complex network theory by allowing reliable estimation of power-law models from data and further allowing quantitative assessment of goodness-of-fit of proposed power-law models to empirical data. pacs. 02.50.ng distribution theory and monte carlo studies -- 05.10.ln monte carlo methods -- 89.75.-k","the structure of scientific collaboration networks. the structure of scientific collaboration networks is investigated. two scientists are considered connected if they have authored a paper together and explicit networks of such connections are constructed by using data drawn from a number of databases, including medline (biomedical research), the los alamos e-print archive (physics), and ncstrl (computer science). i show that these collaboration networks form ã¢ââsmall worlds,ã¢ââ in which randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate acquaintances. i further give results for mean and distribution of numbers of collaborators of authors, demonstrate the presence of clustering in the networks, and highlight a number of apparent differences in the patterns of collaboration between the fields studied.",3
