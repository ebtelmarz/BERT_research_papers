1,"the metabolic world of escherichia coli is not small",42,"The metabolic world of Escherichia coli is not small","To elucidate the organizational and evolutionary principles of the metabolism of living organisms, recent studies have addressed the graph-theoretic analysis of large biochemical networks responsible for the synthesis and degradation of cellular building blocks [Jeong, H., Tombor, B., Albert, R., Oltvai, Z. N. \& Barab\{\'a\}si, A. L. (2000) Nature 407, 651-654; Wagner, A. \& Fell, D. A. (2001) Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 268, 1803-1810; and Ma, H.-W. \& Zeng, A.-P. (2003) Bioinformatics 19, 270-277]. In such studies, the global properties of the network are computed by considering enzymatic reactions as links between metabolites. However, the pathways computed in this manner do not conserve their structural moieties and therefore do not correspond to biochemical pathways on the traditional metabolic map. In this work, we reassessed earlier results by digitizing carbon atomic traces in metabolic reactions annotated for Escherichia coli. Our analysis revealed that the average path length of its metabolism is much longer than previously thought and that the metabolic world of this organism is not small in terms of biosynthesis and degradation."
2,"reverse engineering of biological complexity",43,"Reverse Engineering of Biological Complexity","Advanced technologies and biology have extremely different physical implementations, but they are far more alike in systems-level organization than is widely appreciated. {C}onvergent evolution in both domains produces modular architectures that are composed of elaborate hierarchies of protocols and layers of feedback regulation, are driven by demand for robustness to uncertain environments, and use often imprecise components. {T}his complexity may be largely hidden in idealized laboratory settings and in normal operation, becoming conspicuous only when contributing to rare cascading failures. {T}hese puzzling and paradoxical features are neither accidental nor artificial, but derive from a deep and necessary interplay between complexity and robustness, modularity, feedback, and fragility. {T}his review describes insights from engineering theory and practice that can shed some light on biological complexity."
3,"exploring complex networks",44,"Exploring complex networks","The study of networks pervades all of science, from neurobiology to statistical physics. {T}he most basic issues are structural: how does one characterize the wiring diagram of a food web or the {I}nternet or the metabolic network of the bacterium {E}scherichia coli? {A}re there any unifying principles underlying their topology? {F}rom the perspective of nonlinear dynamics, we would also like to understand how an enormous network of interacting dynamical systems-be they neurons, power stations or lasers-will behave collectively, given their individual dynamics and coupling architecture. {R}esearchers are only now beginning to unravel the structure and dynamics of complex networks."
4,"comparative assessment of largescale data sets of proteinprotein interactions",46,"Comparative assessment of large-scale data sets of protein-protein interactions.","Comprehensive protein protein interaction maps promise to reveal many aspects of the complex regulatory network underlying cellular function. Recently, large-scale approaches have predicted many new protein interactions in yeast. To measure their accuracy and potential as well as to identify biases, strengths and weaknesses, we compare the methods with each other and with a reference set of previously reported protein interactions."
5,"navigation in a small world",47,"Navigation in a small world","The small-world phenomenon — the principle that most of us are linked by short chains of acquaintances — was first investigated as a question in sociology1, 2 and is a feature of a range of networks arising in nature and technology3, 4, 5. Experimental study of the phenomenon1 revealed that it has two fundamental components: first, such short chains are ubiquitous, and second, individuals operating with purely local information are very adept at finding these chains. The first issue has been analysed2, 3, 4, and here I investigate the second by modelling how individuals can find short chains in a large social network."
6,"random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions and their applications",48,"Random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions and their applications.","Recent work on the structure of social networks and the internet has focussed attention on graphs with distributions of vertex degree that are significantly different from the Poisson degree distributions that have been widely studied in the past. In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph."
7,"artificial gene networks for objective comparison of analysis algorithms",49,"Artificial gene networks for objective comparison of analysis  algorithms","Motivation: Large-scale gene expression profiling generates data sets that are rich in observed features but poor in numbers of observations. The analysis of such data sets is a challenge that has been object of vigorous research. The algorithms in use for this purpose have been poorly documented and rarely compared objectively, posing a problem of uncertainty about the outcomes of the analyses. One way to objectively test such analysis algorithms is to apply them on computational gene network models for which the mechanisms are completely know.  Results: We present a system that generates random artificial   gene networks according to well-defined topological and kinetic   properties. These are used to run in silico experiments simulating   real laboratory microarray experiments. Noise with controlled   properties is added to the simulation results several times   emulating measurement replicates, before expression ratios are calculated.

8,"the segment polarity network is a robust developmental module",50,"The segment polarity network is a robust developmental module","All insects possess homologous segments, but segment specification differs radically among insect orders. {I}n {D}rosophila, maternal morphogens control the patterned activation of gap genes, which encode transcriptional regulators that shape the patterned expression of pair-rule genes. {T}his patterning cascade takes place before cellularization. {P}air-rule gene products subsequently 'imprint' segment polarity genes with reiterated patterns, thus defining the primordial segments. {T}his mechanism must be greatly modified in insect groups in which many segments emerge only after cellularization. {I}n beetles and parasitic wasps, for instance, pair-rule homologues are expressed in patterns consistent with roles during segmentation, but these patterns emerge within cellular fields. {I}n contrast, although in locusts pair-rule homologues may not control segmentation, some segment polarity genes and their interactions are conserved. {P}erhaps segmentation is modular, with each module autonomously expressing a characteristic intrinsic behaviour in response to transient stimuli. {I}f so, evolution could rearrange inputs to modules without changing their intrinsic behaviours. {H}ere we suggest, using computer simulations, that the {D}rosophila segment polarity genes constitute such a module, and that this module is resistant to variations in the kinetic constants that govern its behaviour."
9,"the evolutionary origin of complex features",52,"The evolutionary origin of complex features.","A long-standing challenge to evolutionary theory has been whether it can explain the origin of complex organismal features. {W}e examined this issue using digital organisms--computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, compete and evolve. {P}opulations of digital organisms often evolved the ability to perform complex logic functions requiring the coordinated execution of many genomic instructions. {C}omplex functions evolved by building on simpler functions that had evolved earlier, provided that these were also selectively favoured. {H}owever, no particular intermediate stage was essential for evolving complex functions. {T}he first genotypes able to perform complex functions differed from their non-performing parents by only one or two mutations, but differed from the ancestor by many mutations that were also crucial to the new functions. {I}n some cases, mutations that were deleterious when they appeared served as stepping-stones in the evolution of complex features. {T}hese findings show how complex functions can originate by random mutation and natural selection."
10,"early language acquisition cracking the speech code",60,"Early language acquisition: cracking the speech code.","Infants learn language with remarkable speed, but how they do it remains a mystery. New data show that infants use computational strategies to detect the statistical and prosodic patterns in language input, and that this leads to the discovery of phonemes and words. Social interaction with another human being affects speech learning in a way that resembles communicative learning in songbirds. The brain's commitment to the statistical and prosodic patterns that are experienced early in life might help to explain the long-standing puzzle of why infants are better language learners than adults. Successful learning by infants, as well as constraints on that learning, are changing theories of language acquisition."
11,"organization development and function of complex brain networks",61,"Organization, development and function of complex brain networks"," Recent research has revealed general principles in the structural and functional organization of complex networks which are shared by various natural, social and technological systems. This review examines these principles as applied to the organization, development and function of complex brain networks. Specifically, we examine the structural properties of large-scale anatomical and functional brain networks and discuss how they might arise in the course of network growth and rewiring. Moreover, we examine the relationship between the structural substrate of neuroanatomy and more dynamic functional and effective connectivity patterns that underlie human cognition. We suggest that network analysis offers new fundamental insights into global and integrative aspects of brain function, including the origin of flexible and coherent cognitive states within the neural architecture."
12,"motifs in brain networks",62,"Motifs in brain networks.","Complex brains have evolved a highly efficient network architecture whose structural connectivity is capable of generating a large repertoire of functional states. We detect characteristic network building blocks ( structural and functional motifs) in neuroanatomical data sets and identify a small set of structural motifs that occur in significantly increased numbers. Our analysis suggests the hypothesis that brain networks maximize both the number and the diversity of functional motifs, while the repertoire of structural motifs remains small. Using functional motif number as a cost function in an optimization algorithm, we obtain network topologies that resemble real brain networks across a broad spectrum of structural measures, including small-world attributes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that highly evolved neural architectures are organized to maximize functional repertoires and to support highly efficient integration of information."
13,"diffusion on complex networks a way to probe their large scale topological structures",97,"Diffusion on Complex Networks : A way to probe their large scale topological structures","A diffusion process on complex networks is introduced in order to uncover their large scale topological structures. This is achieved by focusing on the slowest decaying diffusive modes of the network. The proposed procedure is applied to real-world networks like a friendship network of known modular structure, and an Internet routing network. For the friendship network, its known structure is well reproduced. In case of the Internet, where the structure is far less well-known, one indeed finds a modular structure, and modules can roughly be associated with individual countries. Quantitatively the modular structure of the Internet manifests itself in an approximately 10 times larger participation ratio of its slowest decaying modes as compared to the null model -- a random scale-free network. The extreme edges of the Internet are found to correspond to Russian and US military sites."
14,"topological generalizations of network motifs",98,"Topological Generalizations of network motifs","Biological and technological networks contain patterns, termed network motifs, which occur far more often than in randomized networks. {N}etwork motifs were suggested to be elementary building blocks that carry out key functions in the network. {I}t is of interest to understand how network motifs combine to form larger structures. {T}o address this, we present a systematic approach to define ""motif generalizations"": families of motifs of different sizes that share a common architectural theme. {T}o define motif generalizations, we first define ""roles"" in a subgraph according to structural equivalence. {F}or example, the feedforward loop triad--a motif in transcription, neuronal, and some electronic networks--has three roles: an input node, an output node, and an internal node. {T}he roles are used to define possible generalizations of the motif. {T}he feedforward loop can have three simple generalizations, based on replicating each of the three roles and their connections. {W}e present algorithms for efficiently detecting motif generalizations. {W}e find that the transcription networks of bacteria and yeast display only one of the three generalizations, the multi-output feedforward generalization. {I}n contrast, the neuronal network of {C}. elegans mainly displays the multi-input generalization. {F}orward-logic electronic circuits display a multi-input, multi-output hybrid. {T}hus, networks which share a common motif can have very different generalizations of that motif. {U}sing mathematical modeling, we describe the information processing functions of the different motif generalizations in transcription, neuronal, and electronic networks."
15,"collective dynamics of smallworld networks",99,"Collective dynamics of 'small-world' networks.","Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators1, 2, 3, 4, Josephson junction arrays5,6, excitable media7, neural networks8, 9, 10, spatial games11, genetic control networks12 and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices."
16,"network motifs simple building blocks of complex networks",101,"Network motifs: simple building blocks of complex networks.","Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. {T}o uncover their structural design principles, we defined ""network motifs,"" patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. {W}e found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. {T}he motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of {E}scherichia coli and {S}accharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the {W}orld {W}ide {W}eb. {S}imilar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in {C}aenorhabditis elegans. {M}otifs may thus define universal classes of networks. {T}his approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks."
17,"authoritative sources in a hyperlinked environment",102,"Authoritative sources in a hyperlinked environment","The network structure of a hyperlinked environment can be a rich source of in- formation about the content of the environment, provided we have eective means for understanding it. We develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their eectiveness in a variety of contexts on the World Wide Web. The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of \authoritative"" information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of \hub pages"" that join them together in the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristics for link-based analysis.  We began with the goal of discovering authoritative pages, but our approach in fact identies a more complex pattern of social organization on the www, in which hub pages link densely to a set of thematically related authorities. This equilibrium between hubs and authorities is a phenomenon that recurs in the context of a wide variety of topics on the www. Measures of impact and influence in bibliometrics have typically lacked, and arguably not required, an analogous formulation of the role that hubs play; the www is very dierent from the scientic literature, and our framework seems appropriate as a model of the way in which authority is conferred in an environment such as the Web."
18,"the anatomy of a largescale hypertextual web search engine",114,"The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine","Abstract In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http:// google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical largescale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want."
19,"spectra and eigenvectors of scalefree networks",122,"Spectra and eigenvectors of scale-free networks.","We study the spectra and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices of scale-free networks when bidirectional interaction is allowed, so that the adjacency matrix is real and symmetric. The spectral density shows an exponential decay around the center, followed by power-law long tails at both spectrum edges. The largest eigenvalue lambda1 depends on system size N as lambda1 approximately N1/4 for large N, and the corresponding eigenfunction is strongly localized at the hub, the vertex with largest degree. The component of the normalized eigenfunction at the hub is of order unity. We also find that the mass gap scales as N(-0.68)."
20,"spectra of random graphs with given expected degrees",123,"Spectra of random graphs with given expected degrees","In the study of the spectra of power-law graphs, there are basically two  competing approaches. One is to prove analogues of Wigner's semicircle law,  whereas the other predicts that the eigenvalues follow a power-law  distribution. Although the semicircle law and the power law have nothing in  common, we will show that both approaches are essentially correct if one  considers the appropriate matrices. We will prove that (under certain mild  conditions) the eigenvalues of the (normalized) Laplacian of a random  power-law graph follow the semicircle law, whereas the spectrum of the  adjacency matrix of a power-law graph obeys the power law. Our results are  based on the analysis of random graphs with given expected degrees and their  relations to several key invariants. Of interest are a number of (new) values  for the exponent β, where phase transitions for eigenvalue distributions  occur. The spectrum distributions have direct implications to numerous graph  algorithms such as, for example, randomized algorithms that involve rapidly  mixing Markov chains."
21,"functional discovery via a compendium of expression profiles",124,"Functional discovery via a compendium of expression profiles.","Ascertaining the impact of uncharacterized perturbations on the cell is a fundamental problem in biology. Here, we describe how a single assay can be used to monitor hundreds of different cellular functions simultaneously. We constructed a reference database or “compendium” of expression profiles corresponding to 300 diverse mutations and chemical treatments in S. cerevisiae , and we show that the cellular pathways affected can be determined by pattern matching, even among very subtle profiles. The utility of this approach is validated by examining profiles caused by deletions of uncharacterized genes: we identify and experimentally confirm that eight uncharacterized open reading frames encode proteins required for sterol metabolism, cell wall function, mitochondrial respiration, or protein synthesis. We also show that the compendium can be used to characterize pharmacological perturbations by identifying a novel target of the commonly used drug dyclonine."
22,"growing and navigating the small world web by local content",127,"Growing and navigating the small world Web by local content.","Can we model the scale-free distribution of Web hypertext degree under realistic assumptions about the behavior of page authors? Can a Web crawler efficiently locate an unknown relevant page? These questions are receiving much attention due to their potential impact for understanding the structure of the Web and for building better search engines. Here I investigate the connection between the linkage and content topology of Web pages. The relationship between a text-induced distance metric and a link-based neighborhood probability distribution displays a phase transition between a region where linkage is not determined by content and one where linkage decays according to a power law. This relationship is used to propose a Web growth model that is shown to accurately predict the distribution of Web page degree, based on textual content and assuming only local knowledge of degree for existing pages. A qualitatively similar phase transition is found between linkage and semantic distance, with an exponential decay tail. Both relationships suggest that efficient paths can be discovered by decentralized Web navigation algorithms based on textual and/or categorical cues."
23,"the structure of scientific collaboration networks",128,"The structure of scientific collaboration networks","The structure of scientific collaboration networks is investigated. Two scientists are considered connected if they have authored a paper together and explicit networks of such connections are constructed by using data drawn from a number of databases, including MEDLINE (biomedical research), the Los Alamos e-Print Archive (physics), and NCSTRL (computer science). I show that these collaboration networks form âsmall worlds,â in which randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate acquaintances. I further give results for mean and distribution of numbers of collaborators of authors, demonstrate the presence of clustering in the networks, and highlight a number of apparent differences in the patterns of collaboration between the fields studied."
24,"classes of smallworld networks",129,"Classes of small-world networks","We study the statistical properties of a variety of diverse real-world networks. We present evidence of the occurrence of three classes of small-world networks: (a) scale-free networks, characterized by a vertex connectivity distribution that decays as a power law; (b) broad-scale networks, characterized by a connectivity distribution that has a power law regime followed by a sharp cutoff; and (c) single-scale networks, characterized by a connectivity distribution with a fast decaying tail. Moreover. we note for the classes of broad-scale and single-scale networks that there are constraints limiting the addition of new links. Our results suggest that the nature of such constraints may be the controlling factor for the emergence of different classes of networks."
25,"spectra of realworld graphs beyond the semicircle law",139,"Spectra of ""real-world"" graphs: beyond the semicircle law.","Many natural and social systems develop complex networks, that are usually modelled as random graphs. The eigenvalue spectrum of these graphs provides information about their structural properties. While the semi-circle law is known to describe the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs, much less is known about the eigenvalues of real-world graphs, describing such complex systems as the Internet, metabolic pathways, networks of power stations, scientific collaborations or movie actors, which are inherently correlated and usually very sparse. An important limitation in addressing the spectra of these systems is that the numerical determination of the spectra for systems with more than a few thousand nodes is prohibitively time and memory consuming. Making use of recent advances in algorithms for spectral characterization, here we develop new methods to determine the eigenvalues of networks comparable in size to real systems, obtaining several surprising results on the spectra of adjacency matrices corresponding to models of real-world graphs. We find that when the number of links grows as the number of nodes, the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs does not converge to the semi-circle law. Furthermore, the spectral densities of real-world graphs have specific features depending on the details of the corresponding models. In particular, scale-free graphs develop a triangle-like spectral density with a power law tail, while small-world graphs have a complex spectral density function consisting of several sharp peaks. These and further results indicate that the spectra of correlated graphs represent a practical tool for graph classification and can provide useful insight into the relevant structural properties of real networks."
26,"multistability in the lactose utilization network of escherichia coli",148,"Multistability in the lactose utilization network of Escherichia coli","Multistability, the capacity to achieve multiple internal states in response to a single set of external inputs, is the defining characteristic of a switch. Biological switches are essential for the determination of cell fate in multicellular organisms1, the regulation of cell-cycle oscillations during mitosis2, 3 and the maintenance of epigenetic traits in microbes4. The multistability of several natural1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and synthetic7, 8, 9 systems has been attributed to positive feedback loops in their regulatory networks10. However, feedback alone does not guarantee multistability. The phase diagram of a multistable system, a concise description of internal states as key parameters are varied, reveals the conditions required to produce a functional switch11, 12. Here we present the phase diagram of the bistable lactose utilization network of Escherichia coli13. We use this phase diagram, coupled with a mathematical model of the network, to quantitatively investigate processes such as sugar uptake and transcriptional regulation in vivo. We then show how the hysteretic response of the wild-type system can be converted to an ultrasensitive graded response14, 15. The phase diagram thus serves as a sensitive probe of molecular interactions and as a powerful tool for rational network design."
27,"protein complexes and functional modules in molecular networks",151,"Protein complexes and functional modules in molecular networks","Proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules form a dense network of molecular interactions in a cell. Molecules are nodes of this network, and the interactions between them are edges. The architecture of molecular networks can reveal important principles of cellular organization and function, similarly to the way that protein structure tells us about the function and organization of a protein. Computational analysis of molecular networks has been primarily concerned with node degree [Wagner, A. & Fell, D. A. (2001) Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 268, 1803-1810; Jeong, H., Tombor, B., Albert, R., Oltvai, Z. N. & Barabasi, A. L. (2000) Nature 407, 651-654] or degree correlation [Maslov, S. & Sneppen, K. (2002) Science 296, 910-913], and hence focused on single/two-body properties of these networks. Here, by analyzing the multibody structure of the network of protein-protein interactions, we discovered molecular modules that are densely connected within themselves but sparsely connected with the rest of the network. Comparison with experimental data and functional annotation of genes showed two types of modules: (i) protein complexes (splicing machinery, transcription factors, etc.) and (ii) dynamic functional units (signaling cascades, cell-cycle regulation, etc.). Discovered modules are highly statistically significant, as is evident from comparison with random graphs, and are robust to noise in the data. Our results provide strong support for the network modularity principle introduced by Hartwell et al. [Hartwell, L. H., Hopfield, J. J., Leibler, S. & Murray, A. W. (1999) Nature 402, C47-C52], suggesting that found modules constitute the ""building blocks"" of molecular networks."

Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using any one of a number of possible ""betweenness"" measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.We propose and study a set of algorithms for discovering community structure in networksnatural divisions of network nodes into densely connected subgroups.

30,"matching words and pictures",156,"Matching words and pictures","We present a new approach for modeling multi-modal data sets, focusing on the specific case of segmented images with associated text. Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-moda  and correspondence extensions to Hofmann’s hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

The problem of audio information retrieval is familiar to anyone who has returned from vacation to find an answering machine full of messages. While there is not yet an ?AltaVista? for the audio data type, many workers are finding ways to automatically locate, index, and browse audio using recent advances in speech recognition and machine listening. This paper reviews the state of the art in audio information retrieval, and presents recent advances in automatic speech recognition, word spotting, speaker and music identification, and audio similarity with a view towards making audio less ?opaque?. A special section addresses intelligent interfaces for navigating and browsing audio and multimedia documents, using automatically derived information to go beyond the tape recorder metaphor."
32,"programmed population control by cellcell communication and regulated killing",186,"Programmed population control by cell–cell communication and regulated killing","De novo engineering of gene circuits inside cells is extremely difficult1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and efforts to realize predictable and robust performance must deal with noise in gene expression and variation in phenotypes between cells10, 11, 12. Here we demonstrate that by coupling gene expression to cell survival and death using cell–cell communication, we can programme the dynamics of a population despite variability in the behaviour of individual cells. Specifically, we have built and characterized a 'population control' circuit that autonomously regulates the density of an Escherichia coli population. The cell density is broadcasted and detected by elements from a bacterial quorum-sensing system13, 14, which in turn regulate the death rate. As predicted by a simple mathematical model, the circuit can set a stable steady state in terms of cell density and gene expression that is easily tunable by varying the stability of the cell–cell communication signal. This circuit incorporates a mechanism for programmed death in response to changes in the environment, and allows us to probe the design principles of its more complex natural counterparts."

However, a difficult question arises for psychologists and communication researchers: ""What are the communicative characteristics of CMC?"" According to the ""cues-filtered-out"" approach, CMC lacks the specifically relational features (social cues), which enable the interlocutors to identify correctly the kind of interpersonal situations they find themselves in. This paper counters this vision by integrating in its theoretical frame the different psycho-social approaches available in current literature. In particular, the paper describes the characteristics of the socio-cognitive processes-emotional expression, context definition, and identity creation-used by the interlocutors to make order and create relationships out of the miscommunication processes typical of CMC. Moreover, it presents the emerging forms of CMC-instant messaging, shared hypermedia, weblogs, and graphical chats-and their possible social and communicative effects."

NF-{kappa}B regulation of I{kappa}B{alpha} transcription represents a delayed negative feedback loop that drives oscillations in NF-{kappa}B translocation. Single-cell time-lapse imaging and computational modeling of NF-{kappa}B (RelA) localization showed asynchronous oscillations following cell stimulation that decreased in frequency with increased I{kappa}B{alpha} transcription. Transcription of target genes depended on oscillation persistence, involving cycles of RelA phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The functional consequences of NF-{kappa}B signaling may thus depend on number, period, and amplitude of oscillations. 10.1126/science.1099962"

We compare four available databases that approximate the protein interaction network of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aiming to uncover the network's generic large-scale properties and the impact of the proteins' function and cellular localization on the network topology. We show how each database supports a scale-free, topology with hierarchical modularity, indicating that these features represent a robust and generic property of the protein interactions network. We also find strong correlations between the network's structure and the functional role and subcellular localization of its protein constituents, concluding that most functional and/or localization classes appear as relatively segregated subnetworks of the full protein interaction network. The uncovered systematic differences between the four protein interaction databases reflect their relative coverage for different functional and localization classes and provide a guide for their utility in various bioinformatics studies."

Its focus is on the function of the system as a whole, rather than on individual parts. This exciting new arena applies mathematical modeling and engineering methods to the study of biological systems. This book is the first of its kind to focus on the newly emerging field of systems biology with an emphasis on computational approaches. The work covers new concepts, methods for information storage, mining and knowledge extraction, reverse engineering of gene and metabolic networks, as well as modelling and simulation of multi-cellular systems. Central themes include strategies for predicting biological properties and methods for elucidating structure-function relationships. From the Back Cover Computational systems biology is a field that aims to develop a systems level understanding of biological processes using computational techniques. This book presents a timely compendium of the state-of-the-art in this new era of biological understanding. A distinguished group of contributors reviews bioinformation engineering and data integration technologies along with biomedical applications. Different computational approaches to model and simulate biological systems are discussed. Current computational research efforts, comprehensively covered in this volume, are focused on regulatory, signaling and metabolic networks. As an exciting outlook new concepts for computer representations on multi-scales predicting emergent properties of biological systems are introduced.

The results describe typical phenomena in mobility: how situational and planned acts intermesh in navigation, how people construct personal and group spaces, and how temporal tensions develop and dissolve. Furthermore, we provide examples of social solutions to navigation problems, examine mobile multitasking, and consider design implications for mobile and context-aware human–computer interaction."

E 66, 026101 (2002)] considered two questions about the scale-free random tree given by the m=1 case of the Barab&aacute;si-Albert (BA) model (identical with a random tree model introduced by Szymanski in 1987): what is the distribution of the node to node distances, and what is the distribution of node loads, where the load on a node is the number of shortest paths passing through it? They gave heuristic answers to these questions using a ``mean-field'' approximation, replacing the random tree by a certain fixed tree with carefully chosen branching ratios. By making use of our earlier results on scale-free random graphs, we shall analyze the random tree rigorously, obtaining and proving very precise answers to these questions. We shall show that, after dividing by N (the number of nodes), the load distribution converges to an integer distribution X with Pr(X=c)=2/[(2c+1)(2c+3)], c=0,1,2,..., confirming the asymptotic power law with exponent -2 predicted by Szab&oacute;, Alava, and Kert&eacute;sz.

This construction process is extremely fast and robust. The co-occurrence of words in sentences reflects language organization in a subtle manner that can be described in terms of a graph of word interactions. Here, we show that such graphs display two important features recently found in a disparate number of complex systems. (i) The so called small-world effect. In particular, the average distance between two words, d (i.e. the average minimum number of links to be crossed from an arbitrary word to another), is shown to be d approximately equal to 2-3, even though the human brain can store many thousands. (ii) A scale-free distribution of degrees. The known pronounced effects of disconnecting the most connected vertices in such networks can be identified in some language disorders. These observations indicate some unexpected features of language organization that might reflect the evolutionary and social history of lexicons and the origins of their flexibility and combinatorial nature."

Even qualitative models of metabolic networks, when subject to stoichiometric constraints, can prove highly informative, and are the first step to the quantitative models, which alone can allow the true representation of complex biochemical systems."

It has recently been used in molecular biology, but so far the resulting networks have only been analysed statically1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Here we present the dynamics of a biological network on a genomic scale, by integrating transcriptional regulatory information9, 10, 11 and gene-expression data12, 13, 14, 15, 16 for multiple conditions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We develop an approach for the statistical analysis of network dynamics, called SANDY, combining well-known global topological measures, local motifs and newly derived statistics. We uncover large changes in underlying network architecture that are unexpected given current viewpoints and random simulations. In response to diverse stimuli, transcription factors alter their interactions to varying degrees, thereby rewiring the network. A few transcription factors serve as permanent hubs, but most act transiently only during certain conditions. By studying sub-network structures, we show that environmental responses facilitate fast signal propagation (for example, with short regulatory cascades), whereas the cell cycle and sporulation direct temporal progression through multiple stages (for example, with highly inter-connected transcription factors). Indeed, to drive the latter processes forward, phase-specific transcription factors inter-regulate serially, and ubiquitously active transcription factors layer above them in a two-tiered hierarchy. We anticipate that many of the concepts presented here—particularly the large-scale topological changes and hub transience—will apply to other biological networks, including complex sub-systems in higher eukaryotes."

Here we point out that weighted networks can in many cases be analyzed using a simple mapping from a weighted network to an unweighted multigraph, allowing us to apply standard techniques for unweighted graphs to weighted ones as well. We give a number of examples of the method, including an algorithm for detecting community structure in weighted networks and a simple proof of the maximum-flow–minimum-cut theorem."

We describe a physically implemented robotic system that applies techniques from artificial intelligence3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 to carry out cycles of scientific experimentation. The system automatically originates hypotheses to explain observations, devises experiments to test these hypotheses, physically runs the experiments using a laboratory robot, interprets the results to falsify hypotheses inconsistent with the data, and then repeats the cycle. Here we apply the system to the determination of gene function using deletion mutants of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and auxotrophic growth experiments9. We built and tested a detailed logical model (involving genes, proteins and metabolites) of the aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway. In biological experiments that automatically reconstruct parts of this model, we show that an intelligent experiment selection strategy is competitive with human performance and significantly outperforms, with a cost decrease of 3-fold and 100-fold (respectively), both cheapest and random-experiment selection."

The complementary roles of inductive and hypothesis-driven science in the post-genomic era","Abstract It is considered in some quarters that hypothesis-driven methods are the only valuable, reliable or significant means of scientific advance. Data-driven or ‘inductive’ advances in scientific knowledge are then seen as marginal, irrelevant, insecure or wrong-headed, while the development of technology—which is not of itself ‘hypothesis-led’ (beyond the recognition that such tools might be of value)—must be seen as equally irrelevant to the hypothetico-deductive scientific agenda. We argue here that data- and technology-driven programmes are not alternatives to hypothesis-led studies in scientific knowledge discovery but are complementary and iterative partners with them. Many fields are data-rich but hypothesis-poor. Here, computational methods of data analysis, which may be automated, provide the means of generating novel hypotheses, especially in the post-genomic era.

58,"highthroughput classification of yeast mutants for functional genomics using metabolic footprinting",296,"High-throughput classification of yeast mutants for functional genomics using metabolic footprinting.","Many technologies have been developed to help explain the function of genes discovered by systematic genome sequencing. At present, transcriptome and proteome studies dominate large-scale functional analysis strategies. Yet the metabolome, because it is 'downstream', should show greater effects of genetic or physiological changes and thus should be much closer to the phenotype of the organism. We earlier presented a functional analysis strategy that used metabolic fingerprinting to reveal the phenotype of silent mutations of yeast genes. However, this is difficult to scale up for high-throughput screening. Here we present an alternative that has the required throughput (2 min per sample). This 'metabolic footprinting' approach recognizes the significance of 'overflow metabolism' in appropriate media. Measuring intracellular metabolites is time-consuming and subject to technical difficulties caused by the rapid turnover of intracellular metabolites and the need to quench metabolism and separate metabolites from the extracellular space. We therefore focused instead on direct, noninvasive, mass spectrometric monitoring of extracellular metabolites in spent culture medium. Metabolic footprinting can distinguish between different physiological states of wild-type yeast and between yeast single-gene deletion mutants even from related areas of metabolism. By using appropriate clustering and machine learning techniques, the latter based on genetic programming, we show that metabolic footprinting is an effective method to classify 'unknown' mutants by genetic defect."

This hinders the handling, exchange, and dissemination of proteomics data. Here, we present a UML (unified modeling language) approach to proteomics experimental data, describe XML and SQL (structured query language) implementations of that model, and discuss capture, storage, and dissemination strategies. These make explicit what data might be most usefully captured about proteomics experiments and provide complementary routes toward the implementation of a proteome repository."

We demonstrate how the intracellular concentrations of metabolites can reveal phenotypes for proteins active in metabolic regulation. Quantification of the change of several metabolite concentrations relative to the concentration change of one selected metabolite can reveal the site of action, in the metabolic network, of a silent gene.

An idealclassifier should combine these two complementary approaches. Inthis paper, we develop a natural way of achieving this combinationby deriving kernel functions for use in discriminative methodssuch as support vector machines from generative probability models.We provide a theoretical justification for this combination aswell as demonstrate a substantial improvement in the classificationperformance in the context of DNA and protein sequence analysis.1 IntroductionSpeech, vision, text and biosequence data can be difficult to deal with in the contextof simple statistical classification problems.

72,"spreading activation models for trust propagation",457,"Spreading Activation Models for Trust Propagation","Semantic Web endeavors have mainly focused on issues pertaining to knowledge representation and ontology design. However, besides understanding information metadata stated by subjects, knowing about their credibility becomes equally crucial. Hence, trust and trust metrics, conceived as computational means to evaluate trust relationships between individuals, come into play. Our major contributions to semantic Web trust management are twofold. First, we introduce our classification scheme for trust metrics along various axes and discuss advantages and drawbacks of existing approaches for semantic Web scenarios. Hereby, we devise our advocacy for local group trust metrics, guiding us to the second part which presents Appleseed, our novel proposal for local group trust computation. Compelling in its simplicity, Appleseed borrows many ideas from spreading activation models in psychology and relates their concepts to trust evaluation in an intuitive fashion."
73,"design and implementation of microarray gene expression markup language mageml",459,"Design and implementation of microarray gene expression markup language (MAGE-ML).","BACKGROUND: Meaningful exchange of microarray data is currently difficult because it is rare that published data provide sufficient information depth or are even in the same format from one publication to another. Only when data can be easily exchanged will the entire biological community be able to derive the full benefit from such microarray studies. RESULTS: To this end we have developed three key ingredients towards standardizing the storage and exchange of microarray data. First, we have created a minimal information for the annotation of a microarray experiment (MIAME)-compliant conceptualization of microarray experiments modeled using the unified modeling language (UML) named MAGE-OM (microarray gene expression object model). Second, we have translated MAGE-OM into an XML-based data format, MAGE-ML, to facilitate the exchange of data. Third, some of us are now using MAGE (or its progenitors) in data production settings. Finally, we have developed a freely available software tool kit (MAGE-STK) that eases the integration of MAGE-ML into end users' systems. CONCLUSIONS: MAGE will help microarray data producers and users to exchange information by providing a common platform for data exchange, and MAGE-STK will make the adoption of MAGE easier."
74,"network reachability of realworld contact sequences",482,"Network reachability of real-world contact sequences","We use real-world contact sequences, time-ordered lists of contacts from one person to another, to study how fast information or disease can spread across network of contacts. Specifically we measure the reachability time -- the average shortest time for a series of contacts to spread information between a reachable pair of vertices (a pair where a chain of contacts exists leading from one person to the other) -- and the reachability ratio -- the fraction of reachable vertex pairs. These measures are studied using conditional uniform graph tests. We conclude, among other things, that the network reachability depends much on a core where the path lengths are short and communication frequent, that clustering of the contacts of an edge in time tend to decrease the reachability, and that the order of the contacts really do make sense for dynamical spreading processes."
75,"a theory of problemsolving behavior",487,"A Theory of Problem-Solving Behavior","In this paper we develop a formal, testable theory of problem-solving behavior with special relevance to individuals and small groups. The theory is consistent with principles drawn from operant behavior and social exchange theories but also incorporates elements of cognitive psychology. Problem solving is defined as a nonroutine activity oriented toward changing an undesirable state of affairs. The focus on change differentiates problem solving from coping, which is oriented toward relieving feelings of stress. A decision-making model is presented, which takes the problem-solving process through its latter stages. The theory is based on two axioms and three theorems pertaining to the process of decision making. These axioms and theorems serve as the foundation for deriving 14 theorems that establish the antecedent conditions affecting decisions relevnat to each of four stages in the problem-solving process. This theory is distinguished from other problem-solving theories in its effort to account for conditions leading to awareness of problems and in its emphasis on generic problem-solving processes rather than on the effectiveness of problem-solving outcomes."
76,"sticky information and the locus of problem solving implications for innovation",490,"Sticky Information and the Locus of Problem Solving: Implications for Innovation","To solve a problem, needed information and problem-solving capabilities must be brought together. Often the information used in technical problem solving is costly to acquire, transfer, and use in a new location-is, in our terms, sticky. In this paper we explore the impact of information stickiness on the locus of innovation-related problem solving. We find, first, that when sticky information needed by problem solvers is held at one site only, problem solving will be carried out at that locus, other things being equal. Second, when more than one locus of sticky information is called upon by problem solvers, the locus of problem solving may iterate among these sites as problem solving proceeds. When the costs of such iteration are high, then, third, problems that draw upon multiple sites of sticky information will sometimes be task partitioned into subproblems that each draw on only one such locus, and/or, fourth, investments will be made to reduce the stickiness of information at some locations. Information stickiness appears to affect a number of issues of importance to researchers and practitioners. Among these are patterns in the diffusion of information, the specialization of firms, the locus of innovation, and the nature of problems selected by problem solvers."

This short communication uses a simple experiment to show that fitting to a power law distribution by using graphical methods based on linear fit on the log-log scale is biased and inaccurate. It shows that using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is far more robust. Finally, it presents a new table for performing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for goodness-of-fit tailored to power-law distributions in which the power-law exponent is estimated using MLE. The techniques presented here will advance the application of complex network theory by allowing reliable estimation of power-law models from data and further allowing quantitative assessment of goodness-of-fit of proposed power-law models to empirical data.

Interactions are modeled by a spatial game and the network of interaction links evolves adapting to the outcome of the game. As an example, we consider a model of cooperation in which the adaptation is shown to facilitate the formation of a hierarchical interaction network that sustains a highly cooperative stationary state. The resulting network has the characteristics of a small world network when a mechanism of local neighbor selection is introduced in the adaptive network dynamics. The highly connected nodes in the hierarchical structure of the network play a leading role in the stability of the network. Perturbations acting on the state of these special nodes trigger global avalanches leading to complete network reorganization."

To address this, we define coarse-graining units as connectivity patterns which can serve as the nodes of a coarse-grained network and present algorithms to detect them. We use this approach to systematically reverse-engineer electronic circuits, forming understandable high-level maps from incomprehensible transistor wiring: first, a coarse-grained version in which each node is a gate made of several transistors is established. Then the coarse-grained network is itself coarse-grained, resulting in a high-level blueprint in which each node is a circuit module made of many gates. We apply our approach also to a mammalian protein signal-transduction network, to find a simplified coarse-grained network with three main signaling channels that resemble multi-layered perceptrons made of cross-interacting MAP-kinase cascades. We find that both biological and electronic networks are ""self-dissimilar,"" with different network motifs at each level. The present approach may be used to simplify a variety of directed and nondirected, natural and designed networks."

84,"evolving a stigmergic selforganized datamining",514,"Evolving a Stigmergic Self-Organized Data-Mining","Self-organizing complex systems typically are comprised of a large number of frequently similar components or events. Through their process, a pattern at the global-level of a system emerges solely from numerous interactions among the lower-level components of the system. Moreover, the rules specifying interactions among the system’s components are executed using only local information, without reference to the global pattern, which, as in many real-world problems is not easily accessible or possible to be found. Stigmergy, a kind of indirect communication and learning by the environment found in social insects is a well know example of self-organization, providing not only vital clues in order to understand how the components can interact to produce a complex pattern, as can pinpoint simple biological non-linear rules and methods to achieve improved artificial intelligent adaptive categorization systems, critical for Data-Mining. On the present work it is our intention to show that a new type of Data-Mining can be designed based on Stigmergic paradigms, taking profit of several natural features of this phenomenon. By hybridizing bio-inspired Swarm Intelligence with Evolutionary Computation we seek for an entire distributed, adaptive, collective and cooperative self-organized Data-Mining. As a real-world/real-time test bed for our proposal, World-Wide-Web Mining will be used.

We give exact solutions of models within this class that incorporate arbitrary degree distributions and arbitrary but independent edge probabilities. We also discuss some more complex examples with correlated edges that can be solved approximately or exactly by adapting various familiar methods, including mean-field theory, perturbation theory, and saddle-point expansions."
87,"bridging epistemologies the generative dance between organizational knowledge and organizational knowing",538,"Bridging Epistemologies: The Generative Dance between Organizational Knowledge and Organizational Knowing","Much current work on organizational knowledge, intellectual capital, knowledge-creating organizations, knowledge work, and the like rests on a single, traditional understanding of the nature of knowledge. We call this understanding the ""epistemology of possession,"" since it treats knowledge as something people possess. Yet, this epistemology cannot account for the knowing found in individual and group practice. Knowing as action calls for an ""epistemology of practice."" Moreover, the epistemology of possession tends to privilege explicit over tacit knowledge, and knowledge possessed by individuals over that possessed by groups. Current work on organizations is limited by this privileging and by the scant attention given to knowing in its own right. Organizations are better understood if explicit, tacit, individual and group knowledge are treated as four distinct and coequal forms of knowledge (each doing work the others cannot), and if knowledge and knowing are seen as mutually enabling (not competing). We hold that knowledge is a tool of knowing, that knowing is an aspect of our interaction with the social and physical world, and that the interplay of knowledge and knowing can generate new knowledge and new ways of knowing. We believe this generative dance between knowledge and knowing is a powerful source of organizational innovation. Harnessing this innovation calls for organizational and technological infrastructures that support the interplay of knowledge and knowing. Ultimately, these concepts make possible a more robust framing of such epistemologically-centered concerns as core competencies, the management of intellectual capital, etc. We explore these views through three brief case studies drawn from recent research. 10.1287/orsc.10.4.381"

89,"on the uniform generation of random graphs with prescribed degree sequences",548,"On the uniform generation of random graphs with prescribed degree sequences","Random graphs with prescribed degree sequences have been widely used as a model of complex networks. Comparing an observed network to an ensemble of such graphs allows one to detect deviations from randomness in network properties. Here we briefly review two existing methods for the generation of random graphs with arbitrary degree sequences, which we call the ``switching'' and ``matching'' methods, and present a new method based on the ``go with the winners'' Monte Carlo method. The matching method may suffer from non uniform sampling, while the switching method has no general theoretical bound on its mixing time. The ``go with the winners'' method has neither of these drawbacks, but is slow. It can however be used to evaluate there liability of the other two methods and, by doing this, we demonstrate that the deviations of the switching and matching algorithms under realistic conditions are small compared to the ``go with the winners'' algorithm. Because of its combination of speed and accuracy we recommend the use of the switching method for most calculations."

91,"whats in a name",556,"What's in a name?","Among the several findings deriving from the application of complex network formalism to the investigation of natural phenomena, the fact that linguistic constructions follow power laws presents special interest for its potential implications for psychology and brain science. By corresponding to one of the most essentially human manifestations, such language-related properties suggest that similar dynamics may also be inherent to the brain areas related to language and associative memory, and perhaps even consciousness. The present work reports a preliminary experimental investigation aimed at characterizing and modeling the flow of sequentially induced associations between words from the English language in terms of complex networks. The data is produced through a psychophysical experiment where a word is presented to the subject, who is requested to associate another word. Complex network and graph theory formalism and measurements are applied in order to characterize the experimental data. Several interesting results are identified, including the characterization of attraction basins, association asymmetries, context biasing, as well as a possible power-law underlying word associations, which could be explained by the appearance of strange loops along the hierarchical structure underlying word categories."

In language, the statistical regularity known as Zipf's law - which concerns the frequency of usage of different words - has been quantitatively related to the process of text generation. This connection is established by Simon's model, on the basis of a few assumptions regarding the accompanying creation of context. Here, it is shown that the statistics of note usage in musical compositions are compatible with the predictions of Simon's model. This result, which gives objective support to the conceptual likeness of context in language and music, is obtained through automatic analysis of the digital versions of several compositions. As a by-product, a quantitative measure of context definiteness is introduced and used to compare tonal and atonal works."
93,"modeling the evolution of weighted networks",576,"Modeling the evolution of weighted networks","We present a general model for the growth of weighted networks in which the structural growth is coupled with the edges’ weight dynamical evolution. The model is based on a simple weight-driven dynamics and a weights’ reinforcement mechanism coupled to the local network growth. That coupling can be generalized in order to include the effect of additional randomness and nonlinearities which can be present in real-world networks. The model generates weighted graphs exhibiting the statistical properties observed in several real-world systems. In particular, the model yields a nontrivial time evolution of vertices’ properties and scale-free behavior with exponents depending on the microscopic parameters characterizing the coupling rules. Very interestingly, the generated graphs spontaneously achieve a complex hierarchical architecture characterized by clustering and connectivity correlations varying as a function of the vertices’ degree."
94,"social structure and opinion formation",644,"Social Structure and Opinion Formation","We present a dynamical theory of opinion formation that takes explicitly into account the structure of the social network in which in- dividuals are embedded. The theory predicts the evolution of a set of opinions through the social network and establishes the existence of a martingale property, i.e. that the expected weighted fraction of the population that holds a given opinion is constant in time. Most importantly, this weighted fraction is not either zero or one, but corresponds to a non-trivial distribution of opinions in the long time limit. This co-existence of opinions within a social network is in agreement with the often observed locality effect, in which an opinion or a fad is localized to given groups without infecting the whole society. We verified these predictions, as well as those concerning the fragility of opinions and the importance of highly connected individuals in opinion formation, by performing computer experiments on a number of social networks."
95,"conservation and evolution of cisregulatory systems in ascomycete fungi",679,"Conservation and Evolution of Cis-Regulatory Systems in Ascomycete Fungi","Relatively little is known about the mechanisms through which gene expression regulation evolves. To investigate this, we systematically explored the conservation of regulatory networks in fungi by examining the cis -regulatory elements that govern the expression of coregulated genes. We first identified groups of coregulated Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes enriched for genes with known upstream or downstream cis -regulatory sequences. Reasoning that many of these gene groups are coregulated in related species as well, we performed similar analyses on orthologs of coregulated S. cerevisiae genes in 13 other ascomycete species. We find that many species-specific gene groups are enriched for the same flanking regulatory sequences as those found in the orthologous gene groups from S. cerevisiae , indicating that those regulatory systems have been conserved in multiple ascomycete species. In addition to these clear cases of regulatory conservation, we find examples of cis -element evolution that suggest multiple modes of regulatory diversification, including alterations in transcription factor-binding specificity, incorporation of new gene targets into an existing regulatory system, and cooption of regulatory systems to control a different set of genes. We investigated one example in greater detail by measuring the in vitro activity of the S. cerevisiae transcription factor Rpn4p and its orthologs from Candida albicans and Neurospora crassa . Our results suggest that the DNA binding specificity of these proteins has coevolved with the sequences found upstream of the Rpn4p target genes and suggest that Rpn4p has a different function in N. crassa ."

In a previous study, we demonstrated that searching for clusters of predicted transcription factor binding sites could discover active regulatory sequences, and identified 37 regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome with high densities of predicted binding sites for five transcription factors involved in anterior-posterior embryonic patterning. Nine of these clusters overlapped known enhancers. Here, we report the results of in vivo functional analysis of 27 remaining clusters. RESULTS: We generated transgenic flies carrying each cluster attached to a basal promoter and reporter gene, and assayed embryos for reporter gene expression. Six clusters are enhancers of adjacent genes: giant, fushi tarazu, odd-skipped, nubbin, squeeze and pdm2; three drive expression in patterns unrelated to those of neighboring genes; the remaining 18 do not appear to have enhancer activity. We used the Drosophila pseudoobscura genome to compare patterns of evolution in and around the 15 positive and 18 false-positive predictions. Although conservation of primary sequence cannot distinguish true from false positives, conservation of binding-site clustering accurately discriminates functional binding-site clusters from those with no function. We incorporated conservation of binding-site clustering into a new genome-wide enhancer screen, and predict several hundred new regulatory sequences, including 85 adjacent to genes with embryonic patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring conservation of sequence features closely linked to function--such as binding-site clusterin--makes better use of comparative sequence data than commonly used methods that examine only sequence identity."

The cumulative production of capital goods is used as the index of experience.  New capital goods are assumed to completely embody technical change. The assumption is made that the model will be operating in an environment of full employment although reference is made throughout to the case of capital shortage.         The implications of this model on wage earners are discussed, and profits and investments are examined. The rate of return is determined by the expected rate of increase in wages, current labor costs per unit output, and the physical lifetime of the investment. Learning is an act of investment that benefits future investors. Further analysis shows that the socially optimal ratio of gross investment to output is higher than the competitive level.   (SRD)"

Here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option, MUSCLE-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles. RESULTS: We compare the speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with CLUSTALW, Progressive POA and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test three variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings), highest speed (MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to CLUSTALW in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length 282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer.
